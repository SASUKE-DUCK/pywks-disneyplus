# pywks-disneyplus

An easier-to-use script for Disney+, unlike the manual 'main_dsnp.py.' 

The commands are straightforward. For example:

```bash
python main.py -url https://www.disneyplus.com/video/7f5b3d77-abbc-42a8-89e0-27a56a3dcca2
```

You just need to add 'pywks' to the script. It's designed to fetch the encryption key, not download videos."

This script has drawn inspiration from other publicly available scripts, serving as a foundation.
